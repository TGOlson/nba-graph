## about

This project is an experiment to view NBA history in a new way. I want it to be like browsing www.basketball-reference.com, but all at once. 

What you see is a large [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) that includes every player, team, franchise, award (and more!) that ever existed in NBA history.

In all, the graph contains: 5108 players, 1728 unique teams, 325 awards, 86 seasons, 53 franchises, and 3 professional basketball leagues. All connected by over 37,000 [edges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory#edge).

As of today, it encompasses the entirety of NBA history up until the end of the 2022/23 season. That means Victor Wembanyama isn't on the graph yet, and Damian Lillard's last season is still on the Blazers -- but once the 2023/24 season kicks off all this will be updated!

This project originally started out as a way to see how NBA team logos have evolved over time (which is super btw, you can see that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/10ryoq1/nba_team_logos_over_time/)). 

## how does it work?
