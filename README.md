## about

This project started out as a way to see how NBA team logos have evolved over time (which is super btw! you can see that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/10ryoq1/nba_team_logos_over_time/)). Eventually it evolved as a way to view the entirety of NBA history in a new way. It's like browsing www.basketball-reference.com, but all at once. 

What you see is a large [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) that includes every player, team, franchise, award (and more!) that ever existed in NBA history.

In all, the graph contains: 5108 players, 1728 unique teams, 325 awards, 86 seasons, 53 franchises, and 3 professional basketball leagues. All those connected by over 37,000 [edges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory#edge).

As of today, it encompasses the entirety of NBA history up until the end of the 2023 season. That means Victor Wembanyama isn't on the graph yet, and Damian Lillard's last season is still on the Blazers -- but once the 2023/24 season kicks off all this will be updated!

## how does it work?
