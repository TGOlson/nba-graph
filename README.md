## about

The goal of this project to explore viewing NBA history in a new way. It's like browsing [basketball-reference](www.basketball-reference.com), but all at once. 

It started out as a smaller project to see how NBA team logos changed over the years (which is super fun btw, you can see that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/10ryoq1/nba_team_logos_over_time/)). Over time it grew into what it is today -- a full fledged [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) that includes every player, team, franchise, award (and more!) that ever existed in NBA history.

In all, this graph contains: 5108 players, 1728 unique teams, 325 awards, 86 seasons, 53 franchises, and 3 professional basketball leagues. All those nodes are connected by over 37,000 [edges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory#edge).

As of today, it encompasses the entirety of NBA history up until the end of the 2023 season. That means Victor Wembanyama isn't on the graph yet, and Damian Lillards last season is still on the Blazers -- but once the 2023/24 season kicks off all this will be updated!

## how does it work?
